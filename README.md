# Flutter Chat App

I am learning Flutter to assist my dear friend in learning how to utilize and implement TalkJS as well as Flyer UI to create a chat feature within a Flutter Application.

Basic build out just to figure out the chat side of things, then will build on it later with the rest of the app.

## Installs/Process
* flutter pub add talkjs_flutter
* flutter pub get
* replace main.dart with example snippet from TalkJS Docs/Flutter
* flutter pub add flutter_chat_ui
* import 'package:flutter_chat_ui/flutter_chat_ui.dart';  <--> Add to main.dart
